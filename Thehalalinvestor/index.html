            <h2>Understanding Halal Investment</h2>
            <p>Halal investing adheres to Islamic principles, ensuring financial activities are ethical and socially responsible. Key principles include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Prohibition of Riba (Interest):</strong> Avoiding investments that generate income through interest payments (e.g., conventional bonds, interest-bearing bank accounts).</li>
                <li><strong>Prohibition of Gharar (Excessive Uncertainty):</strong> Avoiding overly speculative investments or contracts with ambiguous terms.</li>
                <li><strong>Prohibition of Maysir (Gambling):</strong> Avoiding investments related to gambling activities.</li>
                <li><strong>Avoiding Haram Industries:</strong> Not investing in companies involved in prohibited sectors like alcohol, pork, conventional financial services (interest-based), weapons, tobacco, and adult entertainment.</li>
                <li><strong>Profit and Loss Sharing:</strong> Preferring investment structures like Mudarabah (partnership where one provides capital, the other expertise) and Musharakah (joint venture) where risk and reward are shared.</li>
                <li><strong>Asset-Backed Transactions:</strong> Investments should ideally be linked to tangible assets (like Sukuk representing ownership in an asset).</li>
            </ul>
            <p>The goal is to achieve financial growth while upholding ethical and religious values.</p>
